export const siteDailySummary = `**Today's Safety Insights at McDonald's Chisholm**

Our team demonstrated excellent safety awareness today with 49 total ConvoCards submitted. The standout theme is proactive hazard identification, with workers actively reporting potential issues before they escalate.

**Key Highlights:**
‚Ä¢ **Morning Excellence**: Sarah Johnson's comprehensive entrance inspection set a positive tone for the day, ensuring all safety barriers and PPE stations were properly stocked
‚Ä¢ **Quick Response**: The electrical hazard in Storage B12 was identified and resolved within 37 minutes, showcasing effective incident management
‚Ä¢ **Team Vigilance**: Multiple reports about the scaffolding issue demonstrate our culture of looking out for each other

**Areas Requiring Attention:**
‚Ä¢ **Critical**: Level 3 East scaffolding requires immediate structural assessment - multiple workers have reported movement concerns
‚Ä¢ **Process Improvement**: Chemical storage protocols need clarification following MSDS sheet confusion

**Positive Trends:**
The kitchen team continues to excel in maintaining cleanliness standards, with proactive spill reporting preventing potential slip hazards. Our response rate of 87% shows strong engagement across all shifts.

**Tomorrow's Focus**: Schedule scaffolding inspection and conduct brief chemical storage safety refresher during morning huddle.`;

export const siteWeeklySummary = `**Weekly Safety Review: McDonald's Chisholm**

This week marked a significant improvement in our safety culture with 312 ConvoCards submitted - a 23% increase from last week. The team's commitment to hazard identification and prevention is clearly strengthening.

**Week's Achievements:**
‚Ä¢ **Zero Lost Time**: No incidents resulted in lost work time, maintaining our 45-day streak
‚Ä¢ **Rapid Resolution**: Average critical issue resolution time decreased to 28 minutes (down from 41 minutes last week)
‚Ä¢ **Engagement Growth**: New team members are actively participating, with 6 first-time ConvoCard submissions

**Recurring Themes:**
‚Ä¢ **Kitchen Safety**: Consistent excellence in spill reporting and equipment maintenance
‚Ä¢ **PPE Compliance**: Slight dip in break room area - addressed through targeted reminders
‚Ä¢ **Equipment Concerns**: Scaffolding and maintenance equipment flagged multiple times - preventive maintenance scheduled

**Risk Pattern Analysis:**
The most common safety concerns this week were related to temporary equipment (scaffolding, ladders) and chemical storage. This suggests we should enhance our weekly equipment inspection protocols.

**Team Recognition:**
Special recognition to Jake Thompson, Maria Chen, and Tom Williams for their vigilant reporting of the scaffolding concerns. Their persistence in documenting the issue helped prevent a potential serious incident.

**Next Week's Goals**: Complete scaffolding safety audit, implement enhanced chemical storage labeling system, and celebrate our improving safety metrics during Friday's team meeting.`;
